Have user log in via Ethernet for first login
Update Windows, ensure all updates have finalized and no more are available
Install .NET software as per KB0014871
Install Fusion

Installing Windows 11 from Boot media to HUITIZE:

Before turning on the device, connect it to a charger and internet (preferably through a doc), and connect a USB with Windows 11 installation media on it
Get into BIOS settings by pressing f12 on the startup
Choose from a USB
Pick the drive that you connected to the device
Go through the Windows 11 install process (picking language, time zone, etc..)
Insert product key if possible
If not, you can bypass the product key and not use one (continue with limited setup)
Choose Windows 11 Pro (unless specified otherwise)
Once completed, it will start up traditional Windows 11 setup
Disconnect from the internet for the process to avoid forcing a sign-in email
Disconnect the USB from the device to avoid installing cycle lock
Choose all default options, skip anything optional
If it asks to connect to wifi without a skip option, press Shift + f10 (which opens Command Prompt)
Type into the Command Prompt “OOBE\BYPASSNRO” and press Enter
The device will restart and you will have to repeat the Windows 11 setup
Once you reach the wifi setup option again, you should be given the option to skip the internet and continue setup “with limited access”
For the name and password, use the traditional setup
Name: huitadmin
Password: _________
Security Questions: All answers are “Harvard”
Windows will boot up for you to start HUITizing
_________________________________________________________________________

“Huitize” It (Windows Machine):

Please follow these steps:
Go to this link and download both the .ps1 file and the .bat file.
Run the .bat file. This will install the HUIT toolkit, Chrome, Firefox, Adobe, and Office 365.
When prompted by the power shell enter yes (Y) for all prompts to install the applications.
The following will also open automatically:
The Harvard VPN download page
The Harvard Zoom download page
This document
Lastly, Windows settings will open and check for updates.
Then Follow the Below steps to complete HUIT-IZE
Add huitadmin as local admin (Password: H@rvard2021)
Install SCCM (SCCM Agent - HUIT Toolkit)
Run SCCM scans (HUIT Toolkit)
Install Crowdstrike (via HUIT Toolkit)
Install Bitlocker (via HUIT Toolkit)
Join domain (HUIT Toolkit)
Run updates/drivers via Microsoft etc. (This should be done if you ran the previous script)
software center for Office, Adobe, Chrome/FF, Zoom, etc. (This should be done if you ran previous script)
Run SCCM scans (HUIT Toolkit)
If it is a new device, create a ticket with the “New Asset” template and fill in the template
After all other steps go into settings and use this key to activate windows

Adding a Deployed Apple Device to ASM & JAMF:

The first step for this will always be coordinating with the Senior Technician or Manager as they will be the only ones with the “Apple Configurator” app installed on their Harvard Managed iPhone with their Harvard Managed Apple ID.
If the device is outside of Asset Management you should coordinate with Procurement and Refresh to accomplish this first and affix an asset tag.
The next step is copying user profiles onto a temp storage device see attached KB article.
After this, you can start managing the computer as outlined in the imaging guide at the bottom of this document. Make sure you have the senior technician or manager present for this and that they have with them the phone with Apple Configurator.
Once you arrive at the “Country Selection” Bring the phone with the Apple configurator launched near the computer to kick off the enrollment process. This will trigger several prompts on both the phone and Mac.
The rest of the image will run as usual.
You can then copy data over to the Mac before referencing the same document in step 3.
The final step is reconnecting to Harvard Secure and Executing this command:
sudo profiles renew -type enrollment
You should then follow up on the Jamf portal to confirm that the profile was wicked up. If not you should follow up with the senior technician or manager with Apple configurator.

Installing Crowd Strike On Ubuntu

Presetup

Make sure ethernet and power supply are connected to the device
Download the package onto the device from https://agents.itsec.harvard.edu/
Make sure to select the correct version for your OS
VPN has to be on to open this link (gencom is the recommended tunnel)
Set the folder as executable

Right-click on the file and press the option to make it executable
If that is not possible, you can also run the command “chmod u+x (filename)” through the terminal (which can be found in the application list) to use the file in the terminal for the following steps

Opening Falcon-Sensor Package

To open up the Falcon-Sensor package, use the following code in the terminal:
sudo dpkg -i falcon-sensor_7.02.0-15705_amd64.deb
Note: The section “falcon-sensor_7.02.0-15705_amd64” is the package name and should be checked to make sure the name is properly written in the terminal
You can also drag the file into the terminal after the “-i”

Starting Falcon-Sensor

To start the Falcon-Sensor application, use the following code in the terminal:
sudo systemctl start falcon-sensor
Note: The section “falcon-sensor” is the name of the application and should be checked to make sure the name is properly written in the terminal
Check to see if Falcon-Sensor is properly running. This is done by checking on the status using the following code in the terminal:
systemctl status falcon-sensor
When entered, will check to see if the application is properly running, and will say that the application needs to be bound (will be done in the next step)


Binding Falcon-Sensor


Binding Falcon-Sensor connects the version of Crowdstrike installed on the machine with the HUIT management server
Bind Falcon-Sensor using the following code in the terminal:
/opt/CrowdStrike/falconctl -s --cid 0da990e0888a4fe5a58b65cb0afe9c39
Note: The section “0da990e0888a4fe5a58b65cb0afe9c39” is the CID for General. While for SEAS techs this is the most common, make sure you know ahead of time whether you are using SEAS or General CID. Refer to the agents.itsec website if you need to search for the needed CID
If this is a Crowd Strike Install for a PHD or Research / Hilary Corbett, SEAS Computing Security Check ticket you must use the GENERAL CID
Once entered, Falcon-Sensor should be up and properly running. Check by running the status code again

Applying Images to Computers
Overview (READ_ME)
Please Review KB0011682 before preceding with the Imaging Process
The processes below outline the steps needed to image Dell and Apple computers, as well as other custom models. These steps can only be used with Windows on Dell / HP / ThinkPad / Custom Build, and MacOS on all Apple Computers. If you are doing a Dual Boot Linux / Windows it is important to follow these steps and add the Linux after to avoid the Harvard Windows Image cannibalizing the Linux part of the drive. For a stand-alone Linux install please follow the steps to HUITIZE above after the Linux install is complete
Windows Devices
Initial Setup
Open Box:
Connect to a Spare Bench charger (laptops only) – No need to take out the new charger from the laptop box.
Affix Correct Asset Tag:
H-tag or F-tag.
